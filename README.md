This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to input their weight and height, then calculates and displays their BMI. The result is animated for a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

2. **BMI Calculation:**
   - Upon submission, the BMI is calculated using the formula:
     
     ```math
      BMI = \frac{weight(kg)}{height(m)^2}
     ```
     
3. **Display Result:**
